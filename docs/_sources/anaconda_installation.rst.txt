We recommend using Anaconda to simplify the environment setup. Anaconda is commonly used for managing Python packages in user-defined environments. In other words, it allows you to create isolated environments for different projects, each with its own set of dependencies, without interfering with the system-wide Python installation. This is particularly useful in data science and scientific computing where projects may have different requirements and dependencies. First, download Anaconda by clicking the image below.

We recommend installing our conda environment :code:`charisma-env` to run the code properly. This environment has all the dependencies from our entire code. Open Anaconda Prompt, and go to your download directory by typing the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd C:/your_download_path/

To create and activate :code:`charisma-env` with conda, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f charisma-env.yml

   conda activate charisma-env

After creating and activating the :code:`charisma-env` environment, specify the environment and install (or launch) Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator to use our CHARISMA Python package.

Lastly, import the notebook (ipynb) file in the CHARISMA notebook directory and revise the directory path to run the code.
