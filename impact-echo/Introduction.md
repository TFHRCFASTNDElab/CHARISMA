# Impact Echo IE

The IE method is a seismic or stress-wave based method used to detect defects in concrete, primarily delamination. The objective of the IE survey is to detect and characterize wave reflectors or “resonators” in a concrete bridge deck or other structural elements.

## Installation

Inorder to run all of the algorithms developed for Impact Echo, [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) environment is required.

We strongly recommend installing  [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) via conda.


## Peak Frequency Mapping

[`Peak Frequency Mapping`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/impact-echo/PeakFrequencyMapping) is the conventional form of IE data analysis in which we create peak frequency maps by calculating the maximum peak amplitude of each IE frequency spectrum and mapping it to the location of IE test point on the specimen.
