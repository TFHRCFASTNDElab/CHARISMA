# CHARISMA

Collaborative Highway Asset Research: Integrated Sensor-Modeling Application (CHARISMA) is a collaborative platform collaborative analysis and visualization of NDE and other infrastructure data and for the fusion of sensor data with  digital twin models. The latest advancements in NDE technologies have shown improved accuracy and efficiency, implementing these technologies and this provides opportunities to improvement in existing analysis and visualization methods. CHARISMA aims to utilize NDE data and advanced data fusion techniques generated using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to improve defect detection and diagnosis. This open-source platform will enable the codes to be easily shared and integrated into industry research, and help foster the integration of asset inspection, management, and project delivery data for better asset management decision making and facilitating stakeholder collaboration and participation to advance NDT/E and BIM research.

The NDE technologies we currently support are
- [`Impact Echo`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/impact-echo)
- [`Ground Penetrating Radar`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/ground-penetrating-radar)
- [`Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/phased-array-ultrasonic-testing)
- [`Electrical Resistivity`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/electrical-resistivity)
- [`Half Cell Potential`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/half-cell-potential)
