# Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing PAUT

PAUT can be applied to detect cracks and weld flaws in steel bridge members. The technology is typically implemented using longitudinal (straight beam) or shear wave (angled beam) methods. Longitudinal wave methods are used to test surfaces not available for visual assessment, such as detecting cracks in bridge pins, trunnion shafts, or eyebars. Longitudinal wave methods may also be used for measuring the thickness of a steel plate to detect section loss or for imaging corrosion pits.
