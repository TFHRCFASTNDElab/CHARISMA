# Half Cell Potential HCP

The Half Cell Potential (HCP) method can be used to identify corrosion activity of steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures. However, the method cannot directly measure the degree of corrosion.


Additional information about Half Cell Potential can be found [`here`](https://infotechnology.fhwa.dot.gov/wp-content/themes/nde/inc/mpdf-development/Generatedpdfs/Half-CellPotentialHCP.pdf).

## Installation

Inorder to run all of the algorithms developed for Half Cell Potential, [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) environment is required.

We strongly recommend installing  [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) via conda.


## HCP Mapping

[`HCPMapping`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/half-cell-potential/HCPMapping) is the conventional form of HCP data analysis in which we create condition maps by mapping the HCP measurement to the location of HCP test point on the specimen.
