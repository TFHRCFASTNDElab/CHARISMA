# Electrical Resistivity ER

Electrical resistivity is used to determine reinforced concreteâ€™s susceptibility to corrosion and regions susceptible to moisture and chloride penetration.

Additional information about Electrical Resistivity can be found [`here`](https://infotechnology.fhwa.dot.gov/wp-content/themes/nde/inc/mpdf-development/Generatedpdfs/ElectricalResistivityER.pdf).

## Installation

Inorder to run all of the algorithms developed for Electrical Resistivity, [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) environment is required.

We strongly recommend installing  [`charisma-env`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/blob/main/environment) via conda.


## ER Mapping

[`ERMapping`](https://github.com/TFHRCFASTNDElab/CHARISMA/tree/main/electrical-resistivity/ERMapping) is the conventional form of ER data analysis in which we create condition maps by mapping the resistivity value to the location of ER test point on the specimen.
